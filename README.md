# From Data Engineering to AI Engineering 🚀  

Welcome! This repository documents my **6-month transition journey** from **Senior Data Engineer** to **AI Engineer**.  

For nearly a decade, I’ve built large-scale data systems and MLOps pipelines at several organizations. I’ve worked on recommendation engines, misinformation detection pipelines, and data pipelines powering ChatGPT for enterprise use.  

But I wanted to go beyond **vibe coding AI** — and start **building from fundamentals**.  
That’s why I designed this structured 6-month roadmap to strengthen my ML foundations, build applied AI projects, and showcase a portfolio of end-to-end AI systems.
